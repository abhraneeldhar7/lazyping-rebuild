I'm making a project which pings project endpoints and also acts as down detector. Allows users to add projects and their endpoints. Then a cron function pings the endpoints and stores the latency, status and other things in a log.
Techstack: NextJs, typescript, mongodb, redis, clerk.
Your job is to understand this project structure and goal and help me what I ash for.

For dashboard level:
Shows list of projects, alerts, next ping, logs.

For projects level:
Shows last 24hour status using 24 green/red/gray bars, shows latency area chart for the project, logs, alerts, next ping.

For the endpoints level:
Shows 24hour status bars, latency area chart, alerts, logs, next ping.
Endpoints can be paused if user thinks so.

This is the mongodb schema I have made so far, correct some things if necessary:

export interface ProjectType {
    projectId: string,
    projectName: string,
    ownerId: string,
    createdAt: Date,

    githubIntegration: {
        githubRepoId: number;
        githubRepoName: string;
        installationId: number;
    } | null,

    overallStatus: "OPERATIONAL" | "DEGRADED" | "PARTIAL_OUTAGE" | "MAJOR_OUTAGE" | null
}

export type methodType = "GET" | "PUT" | "DELETE" | "POST"
export type endpointStatus = "UP" | "DOWN" | "DEGRADED" | "MAINTENANCE"

export interface EndpointType {
    endpointId: string,
    projectId: string,

    url: string,
    method: methodType,
    expectedResponse: string | null,
    headers: Record<string, string> | null;
    body: string | null;

    intervalMinutes: number,
    lastPingedAt: Date | null,
    nextPingAt: Date,

    enabled: boolean,

    //status 
    currentStatus: endpointStatus | null,
    consecutiveFailures: number,
    latency: number | null,
    lastStatusChange: Date
}

export interface PingLog {
    projectId: string,
    projectName: string,
    endpointId: string,
    url: string,
    method: "GET" | "PUT" | "DELETE" | "POST",
    status: "OK" | "TIMEOUT" | "DNS" | "CONN_REFUSED" | "TLS" |
    "HTTP_4XX" | "HTTP_5XX" | "RATE_LIMITED" |
    "BLOCKED" | "UNKNOWN",
    responseMessage: string | null,
    errorMessage?: string | null,
    statusCode: number | null,
    latencyMs: number | null,
    timestamp: Date,
    logSummary: string
}
