I need to cache the repeated read and write of data in this application.
While the heavy ping funcions are being triggered or user is viewing the dashbaord or when a viewer is seeing the public status page.
The pinglogs uses mongodb time series collection, it doesnt need caching, the rest needs to be cached.
make proper caching mechanisms with existing server actions. optimise the reads and writes for every ping and other functions which are used to see or modify the data. make sure data are consistent.
make api routes for syncing the redis values with mongodb if necessary, do all the proper measures, do it by correct process everything to keep things consistent and keep minimal load on the database and keep things fast. handle the cases when the user updates things manually too. using ioredis, make required services for this. using redis.io and these are the credentials it gave me, hard code them for now:



import { createClient } from 'redis';

const client = createClient({
    username: 'default',
    password: 'wQ40sYQG3OUxhvkKBzno2Zs0YZoIzhQT',
    socket: {
        host: 'redis-10138.c305.ap-south-1-1.ec2.cloud.redislabs.com',
        port: 10138
    }
});

client.on('error', err => console.log('Redis Client Error', err));

await client.connect();

await client.set('foo', 'bar');
const result = await client.get('foo');
console.log(result)  // >>> bar
